# JALSE-SimFarm

Simple JALSE project

Based originally on JALSE-Zombies (https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE-Zombies)

Modified heavily (basically a rewrite) to simulate a simple farm.

Planned functionality:

1. variety of farm animals and plants to eat
2. simple graze-eat-grow lifecyle
3. variety of predators (foxes, bears?, etc) that will try to eat/kill helpless farm animals
4. guard dogs to chase off predators (and maybe try to herd the stupid animals closer to the farm?)

Nothing too fancy, just something to help me get started with understanding and using JALSE
